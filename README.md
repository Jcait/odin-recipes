# odin-recipes

The goal of this exercise is to create a recipe blog and use the HTML knowledge from the previous lessons.

The lesson was pretty good, I feel like Ive got my head more around working with Git and FIle structure since making directories and/or files was done entirely within the terminal. 

Gonna come back to this when I've gotten better.
